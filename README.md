## IntCom

---

IntCom is a web-based platform, connecting international students together based on interests and backgrounds. Based on a keyword inquiry system, this project provides access to collegiate clubs and societies. As a result, IntCom users can find novel opportunities to connect with their student communities.

IntCom was developed by Shane So, Mackenzie Dy, Connor Chai, and Hieu Le. This project was completed in the first hackathon event hosted by Langara College, called Langara Hacks! 2023. Through this event, our team collaborated to solve a problem based on the theme of social community, focused on helping international students connect with each other and find networking opportunities in their community. The flow of our project consisted of multiple stages, including ideation, feature implementation, UI/UX design, frontend and backend development, distribution, marketing, as well as showcasing.
